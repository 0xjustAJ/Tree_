 ### Project Overview

 In this project, a tree house was built with rust programming language to showcase to the public and to all rustaceans the power of rust programming language, and to help beginners navigate quickly there rust learning journey as it cuts across many of rust basic syntax like (arrays, vectors, pattern matching, mutabilities, references, structs, enumerations println! macros, etc).

    The tree house is a party house where we have a bouncer check out side. the duties of the bouncer are as follows:

 - Performing greetings to visitors, and allowing non-registered visitors to be registered and allow entry to the house

 - Placing constraint on visitors less than 21 years old on the usage of alcoholic substance, while prescribing what to drink instead.

 - Placing action constraints (acceptance with a note of warning, refusal, and probation) checks

 - Entry level checks.

### Why Rust Programming Language
Rust as a programming Language has rapidly gained popularity in the software development community for several compelling reasons which are listed as follows:
 - Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection
 - High Performance
 - Concurrency Without Data Races
 - Mordern Tooling
 - Community and Ecosystem
 - Versatility

### Notions About Tree Houses 
A tree house ![tree-house-picture](/home/guild-audits/Downloads/tree_house.jpeg) is a real-life structure [link-to-tree-houses](https://stock.adobe.com/ng/search?k=treehouse) built-in tree, or built around trees, which are designed to provide an often playful space elevated above the ground. These tree houses can be of simple platforms or multistorey platforms (complex platforms) with mordern amenities. Tree houses can be used for secret parties, out of town resting places, adventure purpose, confidential meetings, and so-on.

Tree houses or Aboricultural houses have exixted for many years. Living up a tree-house or holding events there has always fascinated people of different languages and cultures. The oldest proof of aboricultural accomodation as always dated back to the antique Rome when Caligula the Roman Emperor that was assassinated because he believed he was a god [link-to-picture](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/history-magazine/article/roman-emperor-believed-god-assassinated),  decided to create a dinning room up in a tree for one of his bouquet.

### Motivation Behind Building Tree Houses with Rust
In other to show case the power of rust programming language, tree house project was built with it for the fun of learning. 

to run the project and check the fuctionalities for newbies to rust, simply go through the rust documentation on how to do, as described in the why rust session.


### Conclusion 
Writing projects like this, and more projects in rust is a great way to start hands-on with rust.
Thank you for reading through.
